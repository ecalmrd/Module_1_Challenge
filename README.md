# Module_1_Challenge

## Summary
In this assignment, we were to clone a starter code and refactor it. I added semantics to the HTML, organized/consolidated CSS elements, adding alt descriptions to the images, made sure the layout was organized, and the webpage worked correctly after making the changes. After completing this assignment, I gained more knowledge and felt more comfortable with basic HTML and CSS coding.
